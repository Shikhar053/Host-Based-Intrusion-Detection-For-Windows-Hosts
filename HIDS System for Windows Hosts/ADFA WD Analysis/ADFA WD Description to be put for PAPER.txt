so there are 3 folders inside Full_Process_Traces folder
1.Full_Trace_Attack Data
2. Full_Trace_Training_Data
3. Full_Trace_Validation_Data

now, Training Data Folder contains 355 .GHC Files
named Trainind_Background_(A number).GHC

Same Goes for Validation folder but it contains even the attack names... 1827 folders  eg.
 Validation-Backdoored-Executable-Part1_1420.GHC

The Scary part is Attack Data Folder
240 Folders
V1- V12 names of folders(so like there are 12 attacks)
Attacks i saw..
V1. CesarFTP
V2.WebDAV
V3.Icecast
V4 Tomcat
V5 OS-SMB
V6 OS-Print-Spool
V7 PMWiki
V8 Wireless-Karma
V9 PDF
V10 Backdoored-Executable
V11 Browser Attack 
V12 Infectious-Media
now each attack has like either N1-N4 or P1-P4 or S1-S4 followed by number 1-5, so like 5 folders for N1 of V1...and then another 5 folders for N2
for example,  folder name is like
V5-OS-SMB-N2-1
V2-WebDAV-P3-3
V12-Infectious-Media-S4-5
Each of these folders....have like 15-30(rough estimate by me, not sure..some have 17, some have 26 so...) .GHC files
example name: V11-Browser-Attack-N3-5_2444.GHC is a ghc file in V11-Browser-Attack-N3-5 folder

So in other words...WHAT DOES THIS ALL MEAN??? WHAT THE HELL IS GOING ON!!!
