Ideas for Improvement
1. N=600-1000? possibly...if every ghc file is quite big with like 2000+ sequences each
2.  TWEAKING Removing MI + Feature selection etc.
3.if you combine training+validation we get 355+1827
=2182 normal sequences as per paper.. they took 40% or almost 2217 attack sequences... HOW ABOUT...we take EXACTLY 2182 random attack sequence... ie.. number of attack type is exactly = number of normal type 
4. probably using new models for the dataset 
training if nothing works
5. give up or...go full BHAGWAAN BHAROSE
