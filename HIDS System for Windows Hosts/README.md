# Hybrid Host-Based Intrusion Detection System (HIDS)

## Objective
Built a hybrid intrusion detection system for Windows hosts using Python and machine learning classifiers.

## Features
- Detects attacks vs. normal behavior
- Uses supervised ML algorithms
- Evaluates models using accuracy and confusion matrix

## Dataset
- Used **ADFA-WD Dataset** (`Full_Process_Traces` folder) for system call analysis
- Contains normal and attack traces for Windows hosts

## Tools & Libraries
Python, scikit-learn, pandas, numpy, matplotlib

## How to Run
1. Navigate to the `code/` folder
2. Run the main script (e.g., `main.py`)
3. Ensure required libraries are installed (use `requirements.txt` if available)

## Screenshots
